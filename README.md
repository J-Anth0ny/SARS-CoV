# SARS-Cov
This project analyzies two genomes and creates a pipeline that identifies mutations in both.

This project results in the following outcomes:

1) Two tables (DataFrames) listing mutations for each genome.
2) A third table showing mutations shared between both genomes.
3) A simple chart that visualizes an aspect of the data.
